# env-defaults.sh — per-project, override-friendly emulator/Metro settings.
#
# SOURCE this (don't execute it) so the vars carry into the calling shell —
# the package.json scripts do exactly that, e.g.:
#     . ./env-defaults.sh && react-native start --port "$METRO_PORT"
#
# Precedence, lowest to highest:
#   1. the defaults below                    — applied only when the var is unset/empty
#   2. values already in the environment      — kept, because ${VAR:=default} won't clobber them
#   3. .env.ports.local at the project root   — git-ignored; wins over 1 and 2
#   4. a value given on the command line      — wins over everything (see below)
#
# The defaults below are the stock React Native / Android ones, so a fresh clone
# just works. Running this project alongside another (e.g. ser/chat) is what
# .env.ports.local is for — put the divergent ports there, not here.
#
# When choosing an emulator port: the console port must be EVEN and in 5554..5682;
# the odd port right above it is the paired adb port (so emulator-5554 speaks adb
# on 5555). 5555 is therefore not a legal console port — step by twos.

# (4) is captured FIRST, before the defaults below fill these in: afterwards every
# one of them is non-empty, so there would be no way to tell a value the caller
# gave from one we defaulted.

# (the package.json scripts run there). The leading "./" is required: POSIX `.`
# searches PATH for a bare name, so `. ./.env.ports.local` sources the local file.
#
# (4): a value passed on the command line beats the local file.
#
# The local file assigns plainly (`DEVICE_SERIAL="emulator-5562"`), so without the
# save/restore below it would clobber an explicit `DEVICE_SERIAL=<serial> yarn …`
# and quietly act on the WRONG DEVICE — installing to the emulator when you meant
# the phone on the cable, with nothing to indicate it. The ports are per-project
# and belong in the file; the target device is a one-off and belongs on the
# command line, so the command line has to win.

# ANDROID_SERIAL pins every adb and Gradle operation to one device.
#
# This is load-bearing, not a convenience. `react-native run-android` shells out to
# Gradle's `app:installDebug`, and that task installs to EVERY connected device --
# the CLI's own --device/--deviceId flag is not passed through to it. So with a
# phone on the cable and other projects' emulators up, `yarn android` tries to
# install on all of them and the whole build fails if ANY one is out of space,
# even when the emulator you actually targeted had room. adb honors this variable
# too, so the launch:/logs-style scripts inherit the same targeting for free.
