# Assistant — Tools

The tools the in-app assistant actually has, and how to use them. (Provider tool
names must match `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`, so wire names use underscores, e.g.
`db_query`.)

## Domain truth (provided as named resources in context)

`SCHEMA_QSQL`, `TAXONOMY_DOC`, `BUNDLES_DOC`, `LOGGING_DOC`, `IMPORT_EXPORT_DOC`.

## `db_query` — read-only SQL

Run a single read-only `SELECT`/`WITH` against the local health DB; returns up to
200 rows. Use `SCHEMA_QSQL` for table/column names. Query whenever it improves
accuracy (counts, checking for existing catalog entries before proposing
duplicates), but not gratuitously. Read-only: no `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/DDL.

## `propose_plan` — propose an action plan (the ONLY way to change data)

To create/import/set **anything**, you MUST invoke the `propose_plan` tool (a real
tool/function call). Do **not** write the plan as text, markdown, or a JSON code
block — the app can only render and execute plans submitted THROUGH this tool; a
plan described in prose does nothing. See **ACTION PLAN FORMAT** for the input
structure (that is the tool's schema, not text to type out). After calling it, add
at most one short sentence ("I've proposed a plan below — review and approve it").
Never claim a change is done; it runs only after the user approves.

There is no write/`db.exec` tool. Approved plan actions are executed by the app
itself, insert-only and idempotently (see **GUARDRAILS**).

## `view_attachment` — re-view an earlier attachment

A freshly attached image/PDF is shown to you inline on the turn it is sent. Older
attachments appear as `[Attachment "name" … id="…"]` markers (their bytes are not
inline). To look at one again, call `view_attachment` with its id. (Offered only on
providers whose tool results can carry media; if it isn't available, ask the user
to re-attach.)

## Reuse, don't recreate

Before proposing to create any type, category, or item, use `db_query` to check
whether it already exists by name, and prefer the existing entry. When the user
names items without specifying a type/category, search the catalog and reuse the
ones that already exist rather than creating a new type/category. Only propose
creating entries that are genuinely missing.

## "How do I…?" questions

Just answer — name the screen and the minimal steps. No tool needed.

## Planned (NOT yet available — do not attempt or promise these)

- `import.canonical` — import canonical YAML/JSON from an attachment/paste → plan.
- `export.logs.csv` / `export.catalog` / `export.backup` — export data as files.
- `reminders.set` — propose reminder changes as a plan.

Until these exist: for an import, read the attached content yourself
(`view_attachment`) and propose the equivalent create actions via `propose_plan`;
for exports, point the user to the **Backup & Import** screen.
