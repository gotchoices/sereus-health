# Assistant Screen

Contains a single instance of the reusable component `components/assistant.md`.
The component is configured to show a back navigation button in the upper left (and not a dismiss icon).

If the assistant is not configured (no enabled API key), this screen should prompt the user and upon approval, navigate to `ApiKeys` (Assistant Setup).
