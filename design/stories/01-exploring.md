# User Story: Exploring

## Story Overview
I want to use my mobile device to log and assess my activities and conditions so that I can improve my health and wellness.

Context: Bob is 57 and his health is not what it used to be.  When he was young, he was just healthy all the time--pretty much, no matter what he did.  Now, he has good days and bad days.  He suspects he could improve his health by changing certain practices.  Maybe he needs to eat different foods.  Maybe some exercise or another would help.  There are so many different things going on, it is hard to know if certain ones are creating a problem or if others would improve things.  As he evaluates the app, he has a basic understanding that it will be used to record his daily activities in an attempt to find correlations he can use to improve his health.

## Sequence
1. Bob just installed the app on his phone and launched it.  He sees a list, mostly empty, containing a single entry that looks like a note containing some kind of welcome message.
2. He sees an icon that looks like it can be used to add something.  He clicks it.
3. There is a choice to add an Activity, a Condition or an Outcome.
4. He chooses activity.
5. Now he sees choices for things like Eating, Exercising, Recreation, Work, etc.  He decides to try logging what he had for breakfast so he picks Eating.
6. Now he sees a few different types of foods to choose from (Pizza, Corn Chips, Lettuce).  That is not going to be enough.
7. He notices a way to add new items so he selects that.
8. He adds omelette as a new item.  He also adds a items for toast and orange juice.
9. Now they show up in the list so he is able to select omelette, toast and orange juice.
10. There is an entry for the date/time so he sets that back to 8am.
11. He confirms and now he can see his new item in the list.
12. That seemed pretty painless so Bob commits to using the app for a few weeks, inputting all his daily activities.

**Alternative Path A: Exercise
4.1. He chooses Exercise
4.2. He sees a few of the exercises he did but not all.
4.3. So he adds the missing exercises to the list.
4.4. He is now able to select the various exercises so that his single log item consists of several specific items: Pushups, pullups, situps, jogging.
4.5. He is able to set the quantifiers for each.  The first three are just integer numbers (20, 15, 40).  For jogging, he enters 2 miles and 30 minutes for the two quantifiers.
4.6. He also sets the time for his workout: 9am.
4.7. Back to step 11
