# User Story: Exporting the Data

## Story Overview
I want to be able to share my data with my healthcare professionals.  I also want to be able to analyze it using AI and other diagostic tools that may be available outside the scope of the app.

Context: Bob has already been [using the app daily](02-daily.md) for some time.  He now wants to use his data for his benefit.

## Sequence
1. Bob finds an export feature easily from the main screen.
2. He is able to apply filters that limit what log entries are visible.
3. But he wants to export everything so he makes sure the filters are clear first.
4. The export creates a CSV file in his filesystem.
5. He is offered an option to share the file.  He chooses that.
6. He attaches the file to an email and sends it to his doctor.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The user can export all or selected log records to a CSV file.
