# User Story: Graphing the Data

## Story Overview
I want to be able to see trends in my data.

Context: Bob has already been [using the app daily](02-daily.md) for some time.  He now wants to use his data for his benefit.

## Sequence
1. Bob finds a couple outcomes including his headaches and stomach pain.
2. He also finds a few foods he suspects could be causing inflammation (peanuts, chocolate).
3. Having selected these items, he selects a graphing function.  A simple configuration view allows him to adjust a few basic settings such as the date range he wants to include.
4. For now, he accepts the default settings and the app generates a graph which includes all dates (horizontal) and all quantifiers (vertical) each scaled according to their own ranges.
5. Each item is color coded and the graph includes a legend.
6. The graph seems to be in its own tab/context and he can return to other screens in the app without destroying it or losing it.
7. He generates several such graphs of various outputs and inputs.  As he creates each graph, he gives it a short name so he can recognize it later.
8. He can see the list of his current graphs by name and move between them without losing any of them, and they do not go away until he explicitly closes/dismisses them.
9. Before he does, he shares each one in turn.
10. The share option allows him to attach the figures to text messages and/or email.
11. He sends them to his doctor, his therapist and copies himself.
12. Upon reviewing his own email, he sees that the graphs are crisp and clear, suitable for printing with excellent clarity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The user can create graphs of selected items through time.
