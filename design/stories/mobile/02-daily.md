# User Story: Daily Use

## Story Overview
I want to log my daily activities in a way that will help determine which ones are correlated to my health and well-being.  But I need this to be efficient and not be a distraction from the things I need to get done each day.

Context: Bob has already been [introduced to the app](01-exploring.md). He is now entering some more log entries.

## Sequence
1. Bob has been experiencing some health issues.  He wants to log those.
2. He has already figured out to import catalog items and so knows he has some new ones related to how he feels and what he has been exposed to.
3. He selects the choice to add a new item and selects type Outcome.
4. Now he sees choices for things like Health, Welfare, Pain, etc.  He selects pain.
5. Now he sees a few different things to choose from (joint, head, back).
6. He navigates to add new items and makes an item for stomach pain.
7. He sees an option to add a quantifier.  He chooses that.
8. For quantifier description, he enters Intensity and selects a scale from 1 to 10, then confirms.
9. Back to his log entry, stomach pain is now an option so he selects it.
10. He confirms and now he can see his new item in the list.  He selects it.
11. The date looks fine so he selects a 7 for intensity and commits the item.
12. Now it is a part of his history.

Alternative Path A: Logging Conditions (things not in the user's direct control)
3.1. He chooses Condition
3.2. He sees choices for Weather, Stress, Environment.  He chooses Stress.
3.3. He sees a quantifier input and so selects 8.
3.4. He has been in the middle of a lawsuit and it is occupying all his thoughts.
3.5. He sees a spot to enter a comment and so notes the reason for the stress.
3.6. He commits his entry and sees that it is now part of the log history.
