# User Story: Faster Data Entry

## Story Overview
I want to be able to make rapid entries of things I've already logged before.

Context: Bob has made many entries.  Most of the things he does, he has already done before.

## Sequence
1. Bob wants to log his breakfast.  It is the same breakfast he eats from time to time: A bowl of peas with olive oil, a couple of fried eggs, cheese and avocado.
2. It took a little work to build the bundle and its items.  But Bob sees the same entry from a couple days ago.
3. He notices a way to clone that item so he invokes it.
4. The meal log entry is instantly duplicated and he finds himself in a mode where he can make modifications to it if necessary. All of the fields from the original (items, bundles, quantifiers, comments) are copied as-is.
5. He notices that the date/time has been set to the current time.  Perfect.  If anything else needs to change, he can adjust it before committing.
6. He adjusts a quantifier to show that it was a very big version of the meal, and then commits the record.
7. That was fast.  Cloning will be his main version of entering where possible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The user can use old entries as templates to create new entries
